# Git, GitHub and Version Control Deep Learning(Xcode's Interface used)
At the moment I study iOS Development with Udemy Course "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu and one of the Topics is Git, GitHub and Version Control. I used **_Xcode's_** Interface during learning it and you can see another repository in my profile where I did almost same things but using the **_Command Line_** and **_GitHub's_** Interfaces as well.
